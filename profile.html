                I don't enjoy many things these days like I did in the past. But I have been able to find some people that are there for me, and I have been able to find some things in life that I do still enjoy to some extent.

                        Coding- I am hoping that I will be able to wrap my head around the concepts that are needed to code, since I am currently going to school for coding I think that it would be a good thing to know how to do it lol. Although I am not very good at it, fair warning!

                        Gaming- One of the few things that has stayed constant in my life is gaming. I grew up playing xbox and just recently grew a pair and started gaming on PC as of last year (2021).
